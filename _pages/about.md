Hi, I am a fifth-year PhD student in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, working
on human-robot collaboration. I am advised by
[Reid Simmons](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/reid-simmons/) and
[Henny Admoni](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/henny-admoni/),
and am part of the [Human and Robot Partners (HARP) Lab](https://harp.ri.cmu.edu) and
[Reliable Autonomous Systems Lab (RASL)](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/reliable-autonomous-systems-lab/). I am supported
by the [National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowship](https://ndseg.org/).


My research interests lie in the areas of interactive machine learning, reinforcement learning,
and human robot interaction. See here for a [research statement](data/MZ_research_statement_oct24.pdf). I graduated from Caltech ('20) with a degree in Computer Science and a
minor in Information and Data Science, where I worked with [Yuxin Chen](https://yuxinchen.org/) and [Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/) on machine teaching and [Soon-Jo Chung](https://www.eas.caltech.edu/people/sjchung) on distributed control.

**Research**

I'm interested in developing algorithms to enable fluent human-robot coordination and collaboration [2-page research statement](http://localhost:4000/publications/data/MZ_research_statement_oct24.pdf). I currently work on projects focused on uncertainty quantification, human-robot collaboration, adaptation, and modeling human behavior.
