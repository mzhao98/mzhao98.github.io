    <h2>Alt-America: The Rise of the Radical Right in the Age of Trump</h2>
    <p>- David Neiwert’s Alt-America: The Rise of the Radical Right in the Age of Trump details the history of the Alt-Right, a consolidation of numerous conservative groups, including conspiracists, white supremacists, and militiamen. These extremist groups had all been quietly operating throughout the nation prior to 2008, but after Barack Obama became elected president, violent crime and racist sentiment spiked dramatically. People who opposed immigration and gun control rallied with extremist groups, like conspiracists, militiamen, and white supremacists against the Obama Administration. Obama’s presidency played a pivotal role in igniting tensions among conservatives and causing the growth and coalescence of right-wing groups prior to Trump’s candidacy in 2016.
	Since the early nineties, antigovernment sentiment has been brewing. During Bill Clinton’s presidency, the Patriot movement formed as one of the first right-wing, conservative efforts to oppose Democratic policies. The Patriots believed that the vision of America held by its founders was being destroyed by immigration and gun control objectives, which they claimed infringed upon their Second Amendment constitutional rights. Conspiracy theorists took their conservative beliefs a step further. One popular theory among conservatives is that there exists a corrupt government plan, called the New World Order (NWO), to impose a global totalitarian government that will turn Americans into slaves. NWO Conspiracists even believe that black helicopters have been rounding up Americans and placing them into concentration camps. In the 1990s, these right-wing, antigovernment groups were led by prominent radio talk show hosts. Rush Limbaugh, a famous talk show host, led a campaign against Bill Clinton, fabricating stories about Clinton’s scandals and related conspiracy theories. For example, he concocted a tale about a “Clinton Body Count” (54) in which people connected with the Clintons were allegedly dying mysteriously. While Limbaugh focused on attacking Clinton, John Trochmann promoted the NWO theory in the Pacific Northwest by sharing blurry photos of black helicopters. A third radical group, the militiamen, arose in response to conservative gun control fears. Militiamen believed in forming citizen militias to oppose the government in case it ever tried to take away their guns. Samuel Sherwood of the US Militia Association, advocated citizen militias as the only way to counter political changes that he believed were leading to a “civil war (56).” Additionally, David Duke, leading the KKK, made the first attempt in 1977 to start a citizen border militia to defend the Mexico border. Conservative leaders of these budding groups were actively but independently promoting their different ideas. They did not yet have a candidate and a cause to rally behind.
	Prior to Obama’s bid for president, several government incidents sparked outrage as tensions boiled within these right-wing groups. For example, in 1992, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) arrested Randy Weaver, a friend of John Trochmann, for selling an illegal firearm. When Randy evaded arrest, federal marshals staked out the Weaver property to arrest Randy. Unfortunately, a massive standoff ensued that resulted in the deaths of several officers, Randy’s son, and Randy’s wife. This incident, named “Ruby Ridge,” outraged the Patriot movement because people saw this as an abuse of government power, as well as “government overreaction and oppression (52).” Conspiracy theorists saw the incident as strong evidence of the New World Order. Furthermore, in 1993, in Waco, Texas, a botched ATF raid of a Branch Davidian cult left four officers and six cult members dead. The FBI tried to arrest the cult leaders, but the entire cult of 72 people immolated themselves (53). This massacre shocked and horrified the nation. Patriots and conspiracy theorists were both convinced that this raid was part of an imminent NWO. Brewing violence and antigovernment hatred had begun unifying Alt-Right groups.
	During Obama’s bid for presidency, the number of right-wing conservatives increased and people with racist inclinations grew more vocal. The idea of an African American presidential candidate appalled Alt-Right groups. When Obama first announced his run for president in 2007, many conservatives didn’t take his candidacy seriously. Railston Loy of the KKK, predicted, “somebody else down South is going to take him out…If that man is elected president, he’ll be shot sure as hell (90).” As Obama’s candidacy advanced, racists that were once quiet came out of the woodwork. In 2008, Tom Prater, spokesperson for white power group Euro, reported, “I’ve gotten more calls in the last two months about interest in our organizations that I got in all years in the past (90).” Don Black, owner of neo-Nazi website Stormfront, reported “nonstop emails and private messages from new people who are mad as hell about the possibility of Obama being elected.” Membership to the KKK also increased (90). Meanwhile, mainstream leaders like Rush Limbaugh published smear columns that made Obama’s candidacy seem to be all about race and nothing else. Mainstream news websites, like CBS.com, had to shut down comment sections of news stories because there was so much vicious race baiting and death threats in the comments (91).
	Barack Obama’s presidency was the last straw for the Alt-Right. While many Americans celebrated Obama’s historic victory in 2008 as a tribute to the growth and diversity of American politics, conservatives nationwide were outraged and fearful of their new place in America. Bitterness, violence, and outrage brewed throughout Obama’s presidency among right-wing conservative communities. For example, on Election Day, students at Baylor University found a noose hanging from a tree. White conservative students publicly burned Obama campaign signs and threatened to jump black students (94). On Staten Island, during Election Night, four white men beat a Liberian immigrant with a metal pipe, verbally threatened a Latino man, and attacked a man walking home from a shift at Rite Aid with a police baton before hitting him with their car. The Southern Poverty Law Center reported over 200 hate crimes around Obama’s election and inauguration (94). Furthermore, the Patriots, conspiracy theorists, and militiamen merged to form the Tea Party in 2009. Although it was portrayed to only promote conservative ideas of small government and limited spending, the Tea Party specifically opposed every aspect of Obama’s presidency and embodied right-wing populism. Right-wing populists of the Tea Party believe themselves to be the hard-working “producers” of America, facing an elite upper class suppressing them from above and a “parasitic” immigrant lower class leeching off of them from below (4). Many Americans, dubbed the Birthers, accused Obama of secretly being a Muslim, non-American citizen and harassed him to release his birth certificate. Tea Partiers even opposed the Obama Administration’s efforts to help everyday Americans after the 2008 financial crisis. The Tea Party protests, a series of disruptive and violent public demonstrations, transpired in opposition to Obama’s American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Most concerningly, the Alt-Right also adopted a take-matter-into-your-own-hands attitude. For example, Sarah Palin, urged her Tea Party followers by tweeting, “Don’t retreat, instead, RELOAD (133)!” Militiamen took heartily to vigilantism. John Trochmann, founder of the Militia of Montana, said, “when the ballot box doesn’t work, we’ll switch to the cartridge box (141).” Obama’s presidency incited and united the increasingly violent Alt-Right.
	In response to Obama’s political stances, conservative groups united behind the opposite policies: anti-immigration and pro-gun ideologies. The rise of immigration between 1990 and 2000 changed the economic landscape of America as small family-run farms became replaced by large industrial food-production operations. Small Midwestern towns saw more diversity as more Latinos moved into the communities. However, this also caused anti-immigration organizations and white supremacist organizations to fixate on immigration as the next issue to rally behind and recruit for their movement. For example, anti-immigration groups argued that immigrants bring crime to communities and take jobs away from Americans. They also posited that immigrants bring disease and don’t even want to become Americans by learning to speak English. Crime and immigration studies proved these claims to all be false; however, this didn’t matter to Alt-Right believers. Obama’s presidency had awoken the racists, conspiracists, anti-immigration conservatives, supremacists, and Patriots, causing them to converge under one Alt-Right umbrella.
	The timing of Trump’s presidential candidacy was opportune for the Alt-Right. Alt-Right speakers and leaders, such as Richard Spencer and Alex Jones, writer of conspiracy theory website Infowars, implored conservatives to back Trump. He resonated with not only conspiracists and conservatives, but also white nationalists, Klansmen, Patriot militiamen, neo-Nazis, and “white-male-power trolls of the alt-right (268).” People endorsed Trump for his willingness to say anything. However, Trump’s racist and uncensored rhetoric induced his supporters to express strongly their own bigoted sentiments. In a 2016 rally, Trump encouraged violence against Hillary Clinton, “I think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons…Take their guns away. She doesn’t want guns…Let’s see what happens to her…It’d be very dangerous (298).” Trump supporters repeatedly assaulted protesters at rallies, but justified their actions by arguing it was the fault of the protesters. They presumed that if President Obama could legitimize gay marriage, then President Trump could legitimize the Alt-Right. Trump’s victory declared to the Alt-Right that their alternative version of America was correct and that they now held the reins of power.
	Far right extremism has been brewing for the last two decades. The Alt-Right united and rallied behind their hatred of the Obama Administration, which ultimately led to Trump’s election in 2016. Now, Trump’s presidency has legitimized and enabled the Alt-Right, and they hold more power than ever. That Alt-Americans’ delusions are impenetrable to facts, science, or reason makes them dangerous. The rest of America must now unite and rally similarly in order to prevent further spread and ascension of the Alt-Right.
