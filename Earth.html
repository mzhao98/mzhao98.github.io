    <h2>The Uninhabitable Earth, David Wallace-Wells</h2>
    <p>In The Uninhabitable Earth, David Wallace-Wells contends that the effects of climate change are a cascading series that will soon make the Earth uninhabitable. Fossil fuels generate carbon emissions that increase global temperatures, which induce wildfires and droughts worldwide. In turn, warming and wildfire melt the Antarctic ice sheets, which causes sea levels to rise and kills marine life, while draining Earth’s drinkable freshwater. Air pollution and warming further pose biological threats to life on Earth. To endure the problems produced by warming, humans then burn even more fossil fuels. Facilitated by a dangerous positive feedback loop, climate change poses a three-pronged threat to Earth’s land, air, and water.
	<br>Global climate trends reveal that temperatures and the extent of natural disasters are headed in a dangerous direction. In recent years, temperature spikes have risen to a point where “natural” occurrences are becoming more unnatural. For example, the 5 hottest summers in Europe since 1500 have all occurred after 2007. While reported events, such as “the hottest summer in history” or “the largest wildfire,” today seem like common occurrences, scientists have realized that the rising frequency of these events is extremely unnatural. Since 1980, the number of dangerous heat waves globally has increased 50-fold. In India, a day over 95F increases the annual mortality rate by 0.75% (41). However, this benchmark was grimly surpassed in 2016, when India recorded a string of days over 120F. Days with extreme heat also cause countries to burn immense amounts of fossil fuels to power air conditioning. For instance, in Saudi Arabia, 700,000 barrels of oil are burned per day in the summer to power air conditioning (42). In turn, carbon and pollutants from the burning of fossil fuels are released into the atmosphere, further increasing the temperature of the Earth, and heightening the need for more fossil fuels to power even more air conditioning. This positive feedback loop will soon lead to drastic environmental changes in crowded cities. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts 4C of warming by 2100 (40). At 4C of warming, parts of the world will become uninhabitable for humans. New York would become as hot as present-day Bahrain, one of the world’s hottest deserts. And Bahrain would become so uninhabitable that the temperature will induce hyperthermia in sleeping mammals. The problem with urbanization amidst global warming is that dense concrete cities turn bearable temperatures deadly. 70,000 workers in the U.S. have already been suffered severe heat-related injuries, but warming will raise this count to 255,000 by 2050 (40). Increasing global temperatures form a positive feedback loop that exacerbate the problem and will soon lead to numerous more deaths, health problems, and uninhabitable parts of the world.
	<br>Earth’s land is under immediate attack from global warming. Warming will soon turn temperate land into uninhabitably hot deserts with high risk of wildfire. Since 2000, the wildfire season in the western U.S. has increased by 2.5 months. Nine out of the ten years with the most wildfire activity have occurred since 2000 (74). Globally, the wildfire season has expanded 20%. This expansion has not only increased the number of deaths directly caused by fire, but also the number of deaths caused by wildfire aftereffects, such as smoke and smog. Globally, 260,000 to 600,000 people die from wildfire smoke per year (75). Another issue is that when trees burn, they release the carbon stored within them into the atmosphere, turning forests from carbon sinks to carbon sources. These carbon emissions from forest fires and global deforestation further intensify global warming. At high concentrations of carbon, plants and leaves grow thicker, with worse ability to absorb carbon dioxide. Furthermore, soil, responsible for absorbing methane, is disappearing from Earth at a rate of 75 billion tons per year. The remaining soil has lost 77% of its ability to absorb methane, leaving the Earth vulnerable to a greenhouse gas several times more powerful a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.
	<br>Next, increasing temperatures and frequent wildfires extend harm to the global ocean ecosystem. Warming causes Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets to melt, which has produced massive flooding and rainfall across the globe. According to the European Academy’s Science Advisory Council, flooding has quadrupled since 1980, and doubled since 2004. From 1995 to 2015, flooding has affected 2.3 billion people and killed 157,000 (62). The Antarctic ice sheet lost 49 billion tons of ice per year between 1992 and 1997. However, between 2012 and 2017, the rate of melting quadrupled to 219 billion tons lost per year (64). This shows that the most drastic and harmful changes have occurred only recently. To make matters worse, soot and ash from increasingly frequent wildfires land on ice sheets, blackening them. Blackened ice absorbs more heat and melts faster. Melting ice caps increase the sea level, which endangers coastal cities. 2/3 of the world’s major cities lie on the coast and many industries are dependent on the coast for power plants, naval bases, farmlands, fisheries, and ports. By 2100, if warming continues on its current trajectory, high-tide flooding will hit the U.S. East Coast every other day (62). According to the US Geological Survey, if global warming increases only 3C, the sea level will rise 260 feet. A rise in sea level of this magnitude will submerge 97% of both Florida and Delaware, 70% of New Jersey, and 80% of Louisiana (68). Major cities like Sacramento, New York City, Seattle, and San Francisco will be completely drowned. Carbon emissions from fossil fuels have additionally destroyed the ocean’s fauna, stripping oceans of their coral reefs and fish populations. Runoff of fertilizer and chemicals from industrial plants create huge “dead zones,” areas of the ocean without oxygen. The ocean is essentially suffocating and the world’s climate degradation is snowballing at an exponential rate.
	<br>While ocean levels rise, the availability of freshwater on Earth is diminishing rapidly. Only 0.007% of the water on Earth is accessible and safe to drink, which is not nearly enough for the 7 billion people on Earth. Even today, 2.1 billion people worldwide do not have access to safe drinking water (87). Countries with high poverty rates are especially hard-hit. In India today, 600 million people experience “high to extreme water stress” and 200,000 people die yearly from lack of or contaminated water. By next year, 250 million Africans will face water shortages and by 2050, more than a billion people in Asia will lack water (88). Because of melting ice sheets, the half of the world that relies on seasonal ice melt will lose their only source of drinkable water. Many lakes across the globe have shrunk or disappeared, such as Africa’s Lake Chad and Bolivia’s Lake Poopó. Additionally, droughts have caused many freshwater rivers and lakes to turn acidic, further reducing the freshwater supply on Earth. The current trajectory of freshwater shortage poses immense and unimaginable threat to life on Earth.
	<br>In addition to toxic water, air is being poisoned by fossil fuel burning and carbon emissions. Poor air quality is already a widespread problem and threat to global health. Currently, over 10,000 people die per day due to air pollution (101). China, Delhi, and California have all experienced record-breaking levels of smog pollution in recent years, as measured on the Air Quality Index. Global warming causes more ozone to form, and people will soon suffer a 70% increase in the number of days with unhealthy ozone smog. Moreover, droughts increase the dust contaminants in the air. Furthermore, microscopic bits of industrial waste called microplastics are released into oceans and wind up inside of fish and birds. Humans consume around 11,000 bits of microplastics per year (105). But perhaps the most frightening is the biological attack that humans might be under due to climate change. In May 2015, a bizarre wipeout of two-thirds of the saiga antelope population revealed the danger of unknown bacteria. A single bacteria, Pasteurella Multocida, had lived in saiga tonsils for generations with no effect, but an increase in humidity proliferated the bacteria into their bloodstream and organs. This minor transformation turned out to be fatal and mass-exterminated the saiga population (114). Unknown bacteria in animal bodies might have toxic changes or fatal effects when exposed to several degrees of warming. Aside from their unknown impacts, hotter temperatures are proven to increase the occurrences of diseases like Zika, Malaria, and Lyme. Soon, these diseases will proliferate beyond the areas of the world to which they’re currently limited. The World Bank predicts that by 2030, 3.6 billion people will be exposed to malaria (112). Climate changes poses threats to humanity at not only an environmental level, but also a biological level.
	<br>The cascading effects of climate change are destroying Earth’s land, water, and air. Just as the world’s ecosystem functions as an interconnected system, climate change too affects the Earth in interwoven ways. Unfortunately, reversing climate change is a colossal task. There is no single productive way to fix the developing ecological catastrophe. Our approach towards reducing climate change must also be interconnected and will require many courses of action. Only through confluence of technology, climate policy, and a global effort, can we prolong our existence and protect our world.
